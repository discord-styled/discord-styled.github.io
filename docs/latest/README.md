# Introduction

Hey! Welcome you beautiful person to the official documentation of this library for `discord-py-interactions`.

## What is interactions-styled?
`discord-interactions-styled` was born from the idea of writing faster and cleaner code when using the `discord-py-interactions` library that helps us to handle all kinds of discord API interactions.

## And... How?
This library provides you with a complete set of all the functions you might need when using the `discord-interactions` library. You can see it like this:

- `discord-interactions` gives us all the available recipes
- You tell `interactions-styled` what you want to have for dinner
- `interactions-styled` prepares the dinner for you using the recipe

Yes, it's an odd comparison, but you know what I mean... Right? Right?
