# Getting started

### Prerequisites
Hey, we really recommend you to check the [discord-py-interactions documentation](https://discord-py-slash-command.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) first, so you will understand much better everything that is going on here.

### Quick start
First, you need to install this library using pip, to do that run the following command:

```sh
pip install -U discord-interactions-styled
```

Then, you're ready to use `discord_styled` on your code, pretty easy, right?
